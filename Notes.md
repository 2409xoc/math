# Ideas:
- Project Ideas:
  - Curve Image (Re)generation: input image -> identify curves -> create (predicted) f(x) for each curve -> recreate image using f(x) instead of original curve [parameters: f(x) limited to quadratic, cubic, (linear), etc]

# Notes:

### <https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/math.html>:
Mathematics requires no memorization, it requires connective understanding. Everything within the field of math is interconnected, and built up of smaller simpler concepts.

**Understanding Mathematics means to**:

- Be able to explain mathematical concepts and facts in terms of simpler concepts and facts
- Making logical connections between different facts and concepts
- Recognize the connection when you encounter something new (both within and outside of mathematics), that's similar and connected to the mathematics
- Identify the principles within a given piece of mathematics that make it work

**Acquiring Mathematical Understanding:**

- Strive for understanding, rather than memorization
- Do exercises
- Always check answers for plausibility
- Don't use technology to create your answers:
	- Use it to check your answers
	- Take care of routine tasks efficiently
	- Do things that cannot be done by hand
