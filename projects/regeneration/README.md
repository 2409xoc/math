# The "Idea"

This isn't really a well thought out idea, it came to me randomly one day and I thought it was hilarious at the time. I probably was cracking under stress.

> "What if... we take an image. Right? Then we recreate it using a bunch of mathematical functions. Wouldn't that be funny as fuck?"

Ok. This doesn't really explain it **incredibly** well... but I hope this will:

## The Process

Like all computational programs, there's going to be an input (the image), computation (forming mathematical functions) and the output (the recreated image).

The computation has several steps:
- Read Image
- Curve Identification
- Create list of f(x)'s for every single curve
- Recreation of the image using the list of functions

When we're talking functions, I want to be able to limit it however I want: linear, quadratics, cubics, etc. Maybe even the recreation of iamges using geometric shapes. I don't really know yet, but I feel like this is going to be the dumbest thing I've ever coded.


# TODO:
**LITERALLY EVERYTHING**

1. Identify Curves
2. Define Functions
3. Plot
